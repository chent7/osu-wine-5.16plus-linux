### Dependencies:
Provided you have your graphics drivers, desktop environment and `PulseAudio` for sound setup, you will need:\
`wine` or `wine-staging` (5.16 at the time of writing)\
`winetricks`\
`lib32-libxcomposite` (if osu! fails to render and exits)\
`lib32-gnutls` (if osu! fails to connect to the internet)\
~~`samba` (installation of .NET 4.0)~~\
~~`lib32-krb5` (installation of .NET 4.0)~~

### Preperation:
You will need a **copy of osu! installation from a Windows machine**, installer doesn't work in wine 5.16.

**gdiplus**: [windows6.1-KB976932-X86](http://download.windowsupdate.com/msdownload/update/software/svpk/2011/02/windows6.1-kb976932-x86_c3516bc5c9e69fee6d9ac4f981f5b95977a8a2fa.exe) or [windows6.1-KB976932-X64](http://download.windowsupdate.com/msdownload/update/software/svpk/2011/02/windows6.1-kb976932-x64_74865ef2562006e51d7f9333b4a8d45b7a749dab.exe) depending on your prefix, because winetricks ðŸ™‚. Keep these files just in case.

### Setup wine prefix:
#### Initialize:
Mine will be `osu-wine`.\
`env WINEPREFIX=~/osu-wine WINEARCH=win64 wineboot --init`\
**say no to mono and gecko.**

#### Install .NET 4.8:
`env WINEPREFIX=~/osu-wine WINEARCH=win64 winetricks dotnet48`\
I do not recommend `-q` flag especially for installing .NET 4.0, in wine 5.16 there is a problem after installation where .NET Runtime Optimization Service causes recursive processess to fill RAM and swap space.\
**Kill wineserver as soon as you click finish on an installation. You may have to do it multiple times (except for .net 4.8 installation).**\
`WINEPREFIX=~/osu-wine wineserver -k`\
**Select Restart Later if prompted**
